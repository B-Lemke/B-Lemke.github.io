Learn what I think is important to tell you, and see some pictures of my dog. I think this page is worth visiting just for the dog pictures alone, but that might just be me.

                      <p>Programming and web development are passions of mine that I like to work on both at work, in class and at home! This page showcases some of my projects and allows you to see what I've been working on. It gives basic information about each project, a demo for web projects, and for non-web projects usually a link to a code repo. If you have any questions about one of the projects don't hesitate to reach out to me! </p>

                      <p>I write music, and I play music. Lucky for you,I have a bunch of recordings and can share them with you! I have recordings on this page of some of the pieces I wrote and performances that I was in ranging from small ensembles, to my junior recital, to Jazz band. It's a great mix of music and well worth the time to check out. I also list credits for the groups that I was in and some of the recitals that I performed in. If you're curious what I am capable of as a musician, this page can give you a clue.</p>

                      <p>During my undergraduate degree I started to experiment with art. I have experimented with traditional, digital and experimental art and love all three! Explorations have included studies in watercolor, drawing, graphic design, performance, found art, dadaism, fluxism, and collage. This page showcases some of my work throughout the years in a digital gallery. </p>

              <p class="mb-0 text-dark font-italic">I have come gradually to understand that the liberal-arts cliché about ‘teaching you how to think’ is actually shorthand for a much deeper, more serious idea: ‘Learning how to think’ really means learning how to exercise some control over how and what you think. It means being conscious and aware enough to choose what you pay attention to and to choose how you construct meaning from experience.</p>
