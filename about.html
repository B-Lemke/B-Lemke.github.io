      <h2><strong>Who am I?</strong></h2>
      <p> That’s a great question, and one that is hard to nail down in a concise answer, but if I had to I would stick with the title I gave myself on the homepage “A Creative”. My interests, hobbies, work and talents not only encompass a wide variety of topics, but so do my skills. The main thread tying everything together though is creativity. Whether problem solving a bug in a batch of code, composing classical music, exploring and learning about art history, or researching a new topic out of curiosity; each of these tasks broadens my horizons, exposes me to new viewpoints, and allows me to utilize my technical and factual know-how with my soft skills of creativity, perseverance and teamwork. That is why I explore so many subjects, because I can reach out to more people in each field and create an ever-evolving network of peers and friends to better the world.  </p>
